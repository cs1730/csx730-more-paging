# csx730-more-paging Another Paging Activity

Most modern systems support a large virtual address space (e.g., `1ul << 64`).
In such an environment, the page table itself becomes excessively large.
One way to deal with this scenario is to use a multi-level paging algorithm,
sometimes referred to as **hierarchical paging**.

### Getting Started

1. Form into **small groups of two or three** people. These instructions assume that at least one group
   member is logged into the Nike.

1. Use Git to clone the repository for this exercise onto Nike into a subdirectory called
   `csx730-morepaging`:

   ```
   $ git clone https://github.com/cs1730/csx730-more-paging.git
   ```

1. Change into the `csx730-more-paging` directory that was just created and look around.
   There should be a couple different files already present, including a magic `Makefile`
   that will compile, assemble, and link stand-alone C files individually.

### Activity Questions

This activity is open book, open notes, and asking your instructor questions is allowed.
You may find Ch. 9 of _Operating System Concepts_ by Silberschatz, Gagne, and Galvin
useful as a reference.

1. Modify `SUBMISSION.md` to include the name, UGA ID number, course number (4730 or 6730)
   for each group member. Then, **sign the piece of paper that your instructor has at the front
   of the room.**

1. Under "Questions" in `SUBMISSION.md`, provide answers to the following
   questions, assuming you are on a 64 bit system with a 4096 byte page size:

   1. What is the size of the set of all virtual addresses?
      Show your work. You may express the solution in pseudo-C code.

   1. Assuming a single page table, how many pages are theoretically possible?
      Show your work. You may express the solution in pseudo-C code.

   1. Assuming a single page table, how big would that table need to be,
      in the following units: B, KB, MB, and GB?
      Show your work. You may express the solution in pseudo-C code.

   1. Assume that each virtual address is broken up in to three parts:

      ```
      |-------------------------------------------------------|
      | table0 page number | table1 page number | page offset |
      |-------------------------------------------------------|
      ```

      If the number of bits reserved for `table0` and `table1` are
      equal, then how big would `table0` need to be, in the
      following units: B and KB?
      Show your work. You may express the solution in pseudo-C code.

   1. Assume that each virtual address is broken up in to five parts:

      ```
      |-------------------------------------------------------|
      | table0 PN | table1 PN | table2 PN | table3 PN | PO    |
      |-------------------------------------------------------|
      ```

      If the number of bits reserved for each table is equal,
      then how big would `table0` need to be, in the following
      units: B and KB?
      Show your work. You may express the solution in pseudo-C code.

**CHECKPOINT**

1. In `paging.c`, create a `struct` for an `addr_type` that uses
   [bit fields](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/bit_field)
   to define the various parts of four-table, hierarchical virtual
   memory address:

   * Each field should be of type `unsigned long`.
     This is allowed by GCC even in strictly conforming code.

   * The variable for each page number should be `pn0`, `pn1`, etc.,
     and the page offset variable should be called `off`.

1. For convenience, also create a typedef for an `addr_t` type based
   on `struct addr_type`.

1. Under "Struct Size" in `SUBMISSION.md`, please indicate what
   the size of the `struct` is, in bytes.

1. In `main`, initialize an `addr_t` with some page number values
   and an offset value. Then, `make` the executable and use GDB to
   confirm that the binary representation of the `addr_t` contains
   the values in their appropiate locations within the type. You
   may find `p/t` and `x/d` useful for printing and examining
   the values in GDB.

1. Repeat the last step for a couple different virtual addresses
   to test confirm that your `struct` is defined correctly.

**CHECKPOINT**

1. In `paging.c`, declare a [`union`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/union)
   called `entry_type` that has the following overlapping members:

   * `addr_t frame`
   * `union entry_type * next`

1. For convenience, also create a typedef for an `entry_t` type based
   on `union entry_type`.

1. In `paging.c`, declare a page table called `table0` with
   the appropriate number of entried. Each element of the
   array should be of type `entry_t`. In `main`, initialize
   the entries in the table to `0`.

   **CHECK YOURSELF:** Is the size of the table what you thought it would be?

1. Next, implement the following function:

   * `addr_t virt_to_phys(addr_t virt);` -- returns the physical address for a
     given virtual address based on the page table.

     * To compute the address, you will need to follow the table to the
	   next table, etc., until you get to the final table, which will give
	   you the frame number.

	 * If the next table does not exist, then you should use `malloc(3)` to
	   dynamically allocate the table and initialize its values. For this
	   exercise, you may initialize the intermediate tables to and frame numbers
	   such that no frames overlap between addresses. In a real operating system,
	   `kmalloc` (i.e., the kernel's memory allocator) is usually used to create
	   the subsequent tables.

1. In `main`, write code to test your implementation. Provide enough output to
   convince yourself and others that your implementation works. At a minumum,
   this should demonstrate the translation of virtual addresses that take
   similar and different paths through the tables.

**SUBMISSION**

1. **Before 11:55 PM on FRI**, double check that your group member names are listed
   in `SUBMISSION.md` as well as the piece of paper that your instructor has at the
   front of the room, then submit your activity attempt using the `submit` command.
   From the parent directory:

   ```
   $ submit csx730-more-paging csx730
   ```

1. Remember to share this directory with your group members!
